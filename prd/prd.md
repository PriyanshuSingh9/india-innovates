# Bharat Intelligence Engine (BIE) — Product Requirements Document

> *India spends billions on intelligence. Decision-makers still read PDF reports from yesterday. BIE changes that.*

## 1. Executive Summary

The **Bharat Intelligence Engine (BIE)** is a real-time, open-source geospatial intelligence platform purpose-built for the Indian subcontinent. It ingests live news feeds, government data, and open-source intelligence (OSINT); processes them through an NLP and knowledge-graph pipeline; and surfaces actionable intelligence on an interactive map-based dashboard.

BIE replaces the manual workflow of reading yesterday's PDF reports with a **live, queryable, AI-powered intelligence layer** over India's security environment. It monitors threats along the LAC (Line of Actual Control), LOC (Line of Control), the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), and internal hotspots — delivering strategic briefs, instability scores, anomaly alerts, and natural-language Q\&A grounded in real data.

### Why BIE Exists

| Problem | BIE's Answer |
|---|---|
| Intelligence reports are stale PDFs delivered hours or days late | Live ingestion pipeline with < 2-minute classification lag |
| No spatial awareness — events lack geographic context | Every event geo-located on an interactive India-centric map |
| Analysts manually correlate signals across sources | Automated knowledge graph + convergence detection |
| No natural-language querying of intelligence databases | GraphRAG-powered Q\&A with citations |
| Instability trends are subjective | Algorithmic India Instability Index (III) per region |
| Strategic briefs take hours to write | Auto-generated briefs every 6 hours via LLM |

### Target Users

- Defence analysts and strategic affairs researchers
- Government intelligence consumers
- Journalists covering national security
- Academic researchers in geopolitics and security studies

## 4. Critical Path Analysis

These five dependency chains are where a delay cascades into multiple blocked engineers.

| Critical Path | Chain | Risk if Delayed | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **API Contract** | F02 → F03 → F11 → F12/F13 | FE team blocked without real endpoints | Stub data from Day 1 |
| **NLP → Graph** | F16 → F20 → F22 → F23 | GraphRAG has no data | Seed Neo4j manually (F21) as parallel track |
| **Classifier → III** | F19 → F25 → F30 | Instability heatmap stays empty | Hardcode III scores as fallback |
| **GraphRAG → Query UI** | F23 → F28 | Query interface shows nothing | Wire to `/similar` (Qdrant) as fallback |
| **Demo Environment** | F40 → F41 → F42 | No rehearsal time | Allocate Day 19 fully to F40, no new features |

## 5. Data Schemas

See [schemas.md](./schemas.md) for the complete data model covering all API contracts, Neo4j graph schema, Qdrant collections, and Redis caching structures.

## 6. Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| NLP pipeline too slow for real-time | High | Batch 20 items. Run on Railway GPU. Accept 2-min lag. | AI1 |
| Neo4j graph sparse at demo time | High | Seed 1,000 facts manually Day 8. Graph fills organically over 6 days. | AI2 |
| Claude API costs spike | Medium | Cache all responses 24h. Set $50 daily spend cap. | BE1 |
| MapLibre performance on demo laptop | Medium | Cap ScatterplotLayer at 500 markers. Disable HeatmapLayer on low GPU. | FE1 |
| Hindi NLP inaccurate | Medium | Accept 75% accuracy. Focus demo on English feeds. Hindi is bonus. | AI1 |
| Railway service crashes mid-demo | High | Auto-restart policy. Pre-warm all services 10 min before demo. | BE1 |
| FE/BE API contract drift | High | BE1 owns `/backend/schemas.py`. Any change requires team announcement. | BE1 |
| Week 1 overrun bleeds into Week 2 | High | Cut scope: if F13/F14 not done by Day 6, drop and continue. | ALL |
| GraphRAG answers are wrong | Medium | Add confidence score. If < 0.6, show disclaimer. Qdrant `/similar` as fallback. | AI2+AI3 |
| Demo internet fails | Low | Phone hotspot. Pre-cache all Claude API responses for demo queries in Redis. | BE1 |
